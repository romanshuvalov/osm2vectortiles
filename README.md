OSM2VectorTiles makes is possible to create vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data. For a detailed documentation, please visit our [project website](http://osm2vectortiles.org/docs/).

Create a custom base map in minutes with our free vector tiles from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) data. 
This is the easiest way how to switch to OSM thanks to [MapBox](https://github.com/mapbox) open-source tools. Design your own map of world or country, serve raster or vector tiles from any virtual server or your own infrastructure, even offline behind a firewall.

## Docs

The following tutorials are targeted at users of the OSM2VectorTiles project.

- **[Getting Started](http://osm2vectortiles.org/docs/getting-started/):** Quickly get started using OSM2VectorTiles to display maps in your browser. This tutorial explains how to serve downloaded Vector Tiles and use them in your browser.
- **[Create new Mapbox GL style](http://osm2vectortiles.org/docs/create-map-with-mapbox-studio/):** Design beautiful maps with the new Mapbox Studio and use them together with osm2vectortiles.

If you want to adapt the OSM2VectorTiles workflow to create vector tiles yourself the detailed usage guide
will get you started.

- **[Detailed Usage Guide](/USAGE.md)**: Create your own planet scale vector tiles with a distributed workflow using the OSM2VectorTiles components.

You should also check out our associated bachelor thesis **[Updatable Vector Tiles from OpenStreetMap](https://cdn.rawgit.com/osm2vectortiles/bachelor-thesis/882a46977f7b984fc59be188335127d62921c44c/thesis.pdf)** if you like a more scientific approach to the project.
